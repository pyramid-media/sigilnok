# sigilnok
a friendly frontend for Sigil

A while back I wrote a qrcode generator api using Go and a nice open source library *github.com/skip2/go-qrcode*.
Since some people (maybe most) have a hard time with making a HTTP Get request and tweaking the query and such to
fit their needs, I found myself needful of a front end to display the utility. This is the front end I wrote using
Scala JS and the really awesome Laminar library.

The utility is hosted at https://orion.jabgibson.com right now.
